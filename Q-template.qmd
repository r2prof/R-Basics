## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| label: load packages
#| output: false
library(tidyverse)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| label: fig-diamonds
#| fig-cap: "A bar chart of diamond cuts"
#| fig-alt: "more descriptive stuff here"
#| out-width: 50%
#| code-fold: true

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut))+
    geom_bar()

```


```{r}
# Define the prices and their probabilities
prices <- c(10, 12.5, 15)
probabilities <- c(0.4, 0.15, 0.45)

# Calculate the expected price
expected_price <- sum(prices * probabilities)

# Calculate the annual budget
weeks_per_year <- 52
annual_budget <- expected_price * weeks_per_year

# Print the results
expected_price
```

$$

```{r}
annual_budget
```


The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
