To determine how much the lab should budget for next year's frog orders, we need to calculate the expected price of a weekly shipment and then use that to find the total annual cost.

Given the prices for the weekly shipments of frogs follow the distribution below:

Price: $10, $12.5, $15

Let's assume the prices are equally likely. This means each price has a probability of \(\frac{1}{3}\).

**Step 1: Calculate the Expected Price**

The expected price \( E(X) \) is given by the weighted average of all possible prices, weighted by their probabilities:

\[
E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P_i \times X_i
\]

where \( P_i \) is the probability of price \( X_i \).

Given the prices and their equal probabilities:
\[
P_1 = P_2 = P_3 = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
X_1 = 10, X_2 = 12.5, X_3 = 15
\]

The expected price is:
\[
E(X) = \left( \frac{1}{3} \times 10 \right) + \left( \frac{1}{3} \times 12.5 \right) + \left( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 \right)
\]

\[
E(X) = \frac{10 + 12.5 + 15}{3}
\]

\[
E(X) = \frac{37.5}{3}
\]

\[
E(X) = 12.5
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the Annual Budget**

Since the expected price per week is $12.5 and there are 52 weeks in a year, the total annual cost is:

\[
\text{Annual Cost} = 12.5 \times 52
\]

\[
\text{Annual Cost} = 650
\]

Therefore, the lab should budget $650 for next year's frog orders.
